If your parent program receives an argument on the command-line, it must:
    Display a process information report.
    Create a unnamed pipe, using pipe.
    Spawn a child process that inherits the pipe, using fork.
    Read from the pipe (to synchronize with the child).
    Send the child a SIGTERM signal with kill.
    Wait for the child to terminate, with wait, and report the childâ€™s exit status.
    Exit with success.

If your parent program does not receive an argument on the command-line, it must:
    Display a process information report.
    Exit with success.

Your child program must:
    Display a process information report.
    Setup a signal handler with sigaction for the SIGTERM signal that replaces the child 
        program with an instance of the parent program, without a command-line argument using execl.
    Write a message to the inherited pipe, to synchronize with its parent.
    Enter an endless loop that never returns.

test.out shows terminal output.
