This simulates a cache, and prints out whether the simulation was a hit or miss. The program allows for input from file, and is able to do set associativity while the LRU method is used for cache misses and replacements.

I have used the set associativity example from class slides for my input for the simulation (test.in).

Notes: I have not tested with larger cache sizes and addresses.
